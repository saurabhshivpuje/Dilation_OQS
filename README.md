Tutorial on quantum algorithm with the Kraus operators
Here, we provide the code for a general quantum algorithm simulating open quantum dynamics described by the Kraus operators on IBM quantum simulator QASM. This code allows you to choose your Kraus operators and initial density matrix, these are the two only input requirement. The example discussed in this code is the amplitude damping model. For detailed explanations, please refer our works: Sci Rep 10, 3301 (2020)https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-60321-x And Quantum 6, 726 (2022)https://doi.org/10.22331/q-2022-05-30-726. The python and IBM qiskit codes of algorithm involved in implementing the Kraus operators are included in the following order:
